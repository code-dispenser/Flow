## Overview

Currently working on docs before releasing to nuget . . .

<!-- Any feedback, positive or negative, is welcome, especially surrounding scenarios/usage. ==>

## Acknowledgments

This library uses attributes from the [protobuf-net library package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/protobuf-net) to enable flow and its failure classes to be serialized and
deserialized using gRPC code first. Many thanks to Marc Gravell the creator of the project and to all the contributors that both work on, and maintain it.
